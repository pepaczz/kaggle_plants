# Plant Seedlings Classification
## Kaggle comptition to analyse and classify image data

This repository contains several scripts and notebooks related to the [Kaggle competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/plant-seedlings-classification). There two mian goals of these scripts:

### 1. dimensionality reduction using PCA and t-SNE and data visualization

Please refer to this notebook for results and visualizations:

### 2. data classification using convolutional neural network (CNN)

Please refer to thee scripts for the model estimation and its evaluations:
