# Plant Seedlings Classification
## Kaggle comptition to analyse and classify image data

This repository contains several scripts and notebooks. There two mian goals:

### 1. dimensionality reduction using PCA and t-SNE and data visualization

Please refer to this notebook for results and visualizations:

### 2. data classification using convolutional neural network (CNN)

Please refer to thee scripts for the model estimation and its evaluations:
